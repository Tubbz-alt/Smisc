\title{Calculates a sequence of CUSUM statistics}
\usage{
cusum(X, k, h, initial = 0, reset = TRUE)

\method{print}{cusum}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector.}

\item{k}{The reference value.}

\item{h}{The upper control limit.}

\item{initial}{The starting value of the CUSUM (\emph{C[0]}).}

\item{reset}{Logical indicating whether the CUSUM is reset to  0 after crossing the control limit.}

\item{\dots}{Additional arguments to \code{\link{print.default}}}
}
\value{
A object of class 'cusum', which is a vector of the CUSUM statistics, along with the following attributes:
\code{X}, \code{k}, \code{h}, \code{initial}, and \code{reset} (which correspond to the original arguments provided to
the function) and \code{resetCounter}, a vector of integers corresponding to \code{cusum} that indicates when the 
CUSUM resets.
}
\description{
Calculates a sequence of one-sided upper CUSUM statistics given the reference value and
the control limit.
}
\details{
CUSUM is assumed to be of the form: \emph{C[i] = max(0, C[i-1] + X[i] - k)},
where the signal occurs when \emph{C[i] > h}.  Note that \code{X} can be the CUSUM scores, or weights,
given by the log-likelihood ratio, in which case \code{k = 0} would make sense.
