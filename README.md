### *Smisc* (Sego Miscellaneous) 

An R package containing a collection of functions for statistical computing and data manipulation

To install:

    library(devtools)
    install_github("pnnl/Smisc")

A few notes about installation:
- The `devtools` package, which is available from CRAN
- Note that `Smisc` does contain C code that requires compilation:  
For Mac, you'll need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), 
for Windows, you'll need to install [R tools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/), 
and for Linux, compilation should take place "automatically."
